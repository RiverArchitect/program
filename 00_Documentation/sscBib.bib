  abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical approach to the problem of designing
	the opening in a slit-check dam. The approach is based on the conservation
	of the mass of water and sediments and on the energy balance under
	steady conditions. It leads to a relationship among opening width,
	sediment characteristics, mountain river geometry, and water and
	sediment discharge. The final relationship can be simplified to make
	it suitable for practical applications. Also, the problem of unsteadiness
	of both water and sediment is considered, as well as the possibility
	of treating the unsteady flow as a sequence of steady states. The
	results of the theory were checked in a laboratory investigation
	using a scale model. Different opening widths were tested under conditions
	of steady and unsteady supplies of water and sediment. The mean grain
	size of the sediment, as well as the rates of sediment and water
	discharge, were changed in the experiments. The results of the experiments
	confirm the theory quite well.},

In contrast to other conventional MCDM techniques, SMCA has the ability to address uneven spatial distribution of criteria values in the evaluation and ranking of alternatives under various uncertainties. Using this technique, a new flood management tool has been developed within the framework of widely used GIS software ArcGIS. This tool has a user friendly interface which allows construction of user defined criteria, running of SCP computations under uncertain impacting factors and visualization of results. This tool has also the ability to interact with and use of classified Remote Sensing (RS) image layers, and other GIS feature layers like census block boundaries for flood damage calculation and loss of life estimation. The 100-year flood management strategy for Oconee River near the City of Milledgeville, Georgia, USA is chosen as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the software. The test result indicates that this new SMCA tool provides a very versatile environment for spatial comparison of various flood mitigation alternatives by taking into account various uncertainties, which will greatly enhance the quality of the decision making process. This tool can also be easily modified and implemented for solving a large variety of problems related to natural resources planning and management.},

  abstract = {Abstract An eco-hydraulic model is described, namely, WW-Eco-tools. The model is composed of hydro-morpho-dynamic, habitat, and population models. Fish habitat suitability models assess habitat quality, based on abiotic parameters, namely, flow velocity, depth, and substratum data. These are all derived from a hydro-morpho-dynamic model. The relationships between parameters and habitat features are represented as suitability index curves (SI curves) or fuzzy rules. To dynamically simulate fish species, two different population models are developed. The first is converted from a logistic population concept. Its model parameters are related to time-dependent fish habitat conditions, namely, weighted usable areas and an overall suitability index. The second model is based on a matrix population concept, with numbers as the only state vector. Age-specific fecundities and survival rates depend on the habitat qualities defined in the matrix population model. The eco-hydraulic model provides very promising results, highlighting the fundamental role of temporal variability of hydro-morphological parameters in structuring habitat and populations of fish species. Using this software to anticipate water management changes, simulated population trends can help decision-makers optimize management measures.},

Modelers lack objective guidance of how to select the most appropriate one for a specific application. Such guidance can be provided by Bayesian model selection (BMS). Its applicability is however limited by high computational costs. To transfer it to computationally expensive river modeling tasks, we propose to combine BMS with model reduction based on arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion. To account for approximation errors in the reduced models, we introduce a novel correction factor that yields a reliable model ranking even under strong computational time constraints. We demonstrate our proposed approach on a case study for a 10-km stretch of the lower Rhine river. The correction factor may shield us from misleading model ranking results. In our case, the correction factor was shown to increase the confidence in model selection.},

Methods that identify areas prone to piping erosion at the regional scale are limited. The main objective of this research is to develop a novel modeling approach by using three machine learning algorithmsmixture discriminant analysis (MDA), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), and support vector machine (SVM) in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to map susceptibility to piping erosion in the loess-covered hilly region of Golestan Province, Northeast Iran. In this research, we have used 22 geo-environmental indices/factors and 345 identified pipes as predictors and dependent variables. The piping susceptibility maps were assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Validation of the results showed that the AUC for the three mentioned algorithms varied from 90.32% to 92.45%. We concluded that the proposed approach could efficiently produce a piping susceptibility map.},

  abstract = {The structure and function of rivers have long been characterized either by: (1) qualitative models such as the River Continuum Concept or Serial Discontinuity Concept which paint broad descriptive portraits of how river habitats and communities vary, or (2) quantitative models, such as downstream hydraulic geometry, which rely on a limited number of measurements spread widely throughout a river basin. In contrast, authors such as Fausch et al. (2002) and Wiens (2002) proposed applying existing quantitative, spatially comprehensive ecology and landscape ecology methods to rivers. This new framework for river sciences which preserves variability and spatial relationships is called a riverine landscape or a riverscape. Application of this riverscape concept requires information on the spatial distribution of organism-scale habitats throughout entire river systems. This article examines the ways in which recent technical and methodological developments can allow us to quantitatively implement and realize the riverscape concept. Using 3-cm true color aerial photos and 5-m resolution elevation data from the River Tromie, Scotland, we apply the newly developed Fluvial Information System which integrates a suite of cutting edge, high resolution, remote sensing methods in a spatially explicit framework. This new integrated approach allows for the extraction of primary fluvial variables such as width, depth, particle size, and elevation. From these first-order variables, we derive second-order geomorphic and hydraulic variables including velocity, stream power, Froude number and shear stress. Channel slope can be approximated from available topographic data. Based on these first and second-order variables, we produce riverscape metrics that begin to explore how geomorphic structures may influence river habitats, including connectivity, patchiness of habitat, and habitat distributions. The results show a complex interplay of geomorphic variable and habitat patchiness that is not predicted by existing fluvial theory. Riverscapes, thus, challenge the existing understanding of how rivers structure themselves and will force development of new paradigms.},

  abstract = {Transect-based hydraulic geometry is well established but depends on a complex set of subjective fieldwork and computational decisions that sometimes go unexplained. As a result, it is ripe for reenvisioning in the light of the emergence of meter-scale, spatially explicit data and algorithmic geospatial analysis. This study developed and evaluated a new spatially explicit method for analyzing discharge-dependent hydraulics coined hydraulic topography that not only increases accuracy but also eliminates several sample- and assumption-based inconsistencies. Using data and hydrodynamic simulations from the regulated, gravelcobble-bed lower Yuba River in California, power functions were fitted to discharge-dependent average width, depth, and depth-weighted velocity for three spatial scales and then their corresponding exponents and coefficients were compared across scales and against ones computed using traditional approaches. Average hydraulic values from cross sections at the segment scale spanned up to 1.5 orders of magnitude for a given discharge. Transect-determined exponents for reach-scale depth and velocity relations were consistently over- and underestimated, respectively, relative to the hydraulic topography benchmark. Overall, 73% of cross-sectional power regression parameters assessed fell between 10 and 50 absolute percent error with respect to the spatially explicit hydraulic topography baseline. Although traditional transect-based sampling may be viable for certain uses, percent errors of this magnitude could compromise engineering applications in river management and training works.},

  abstract  = {Summary This chapter deals with hydraulic modelling for predicting flow properties used in ecohydraulics, in its broader sense, which encompasses aquatic habitat modelling, ecological assessment and the interaction between flow and organisms. It discusses the basic knowledge and terminology of hydraulic modelling. The chapter focuses on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling and its application in ecohydraulics. It describes the fundamental equations of CFD. The methods for predicting flow properties are divided into four categories: three-dimensional (3D) hydraulic models, two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models, one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models and non-numerical hydraulic modelling. The chapter introduces the fundamental topics and concepts of numerical modeling. It describes the features of and differences among hydraulic model approaches and the major elements needed to set up numerical models. The chapter presents four case studies where the underlying hydrodynamic processes drive certain ecological functions, such as the availability of habitats for certain fish or types of vegetation.},

This research utilised a small-scale survey methodology to explore relationships among the ecological and morphological goals of scientists and the aesthetic goals of the public using the Twin Streams Catchment, Auckland, New Zealand, as a case study. Analyses using a linear model and a generalised linear mixed model showed statistically significant relationships between perceived naturalness of landscapes and their aesthetic ratings, and among ratings of perceived naturalness and ecological integrity and morphological condition. Expert measures of health and the aesthetic evaluations of the public were well aligned, indicating public preferences for landscapes of high ecological integrity with good morphological condition. Further analysis revealed participants used cues to care to rate naturalness. This suggests that environmental education endeavours could further align values with these cues in efforts to enhance approaches to landscape sustainability.},
